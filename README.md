# Overview

I have crafted a webpage enabling users to search for products through the eBay API and showcased the results on the very page beneath the search form. The webpage comprised three essential components: a search form, a result table, and an item info card.

My webpage was designed to support users in adding products to and removing them from their wish list. Additionally, it facilitated the sharing of product information via Facebook. This is the frontend code for the website
